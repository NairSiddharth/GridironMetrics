# GridironMetrics

NFL Stats Project that'll try to quantify certain positional performance and/or team performance based off of widely available NFL stats

## Potential Stats to include

block rate -> passing and rushing to see if the players are getting good blocking or not and succeeding anyway
scheme (10 man, 11 man, 12 man)? different situations that stretch the defense harder for weighting reasons
3rd down conversions, avg. yds to go on those conversions so that we can try to show consistency that way
catch rate compared to avg. wr?
talent around them, potentially ding players who have great players around them partially (or boost those that dont)?

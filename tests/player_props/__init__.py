- evaluate_ml_model.py: Evaluate ML model predictions vs baseline
- evaluate_ml_model_multi_year.py: Multi-year ML model evaluation
- backtest_props.py: Backtest prop predictions on historical data
- test_props_performance.py: Test prop prediction performance metrics
- test_prop_baseline.py: Test baseline prediction methods
- validate_week10.py: Validate predictions for Week 10 data
